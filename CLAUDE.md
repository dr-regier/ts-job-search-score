### AI Integration

- Uses AI SDK 5's `streamText()` for streaming responses
- Configured for GPT-5 via OpenAI provider
- Multi-agent architecture with three specialized agents:
  - **Job Discovery Agent** (`/api/chat`) - Autonomous job search across multiple sources
  - **Job Matching Agent** (`/api/match`) - Intelligent scoring and fit analysis
  - **Resume Generator Agent** (`/api/resume`) - AI-powered resume tailoring for specific jobs
- MCP Firecrawl integration via `getFirecrawlMCPClient()` in `/lib/mcp/`
- Custom tools: Adzuna API search, display jobs (progressive carousel), save jobs, score jobs, generate tailored resumes
- System instructions defined in `components/agent/prompts/`
- Agent coordination via localStorage (no direct agent-to-agent calls)
- use useChat for all streaming handling (read the doc first, always, before writing any streaming code: https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat)
- **CRITICAL**: `sendMessage()` from useChat ONLY accepts UIMessage-compatible objects: `sendMessage({ text: "message" })`
- **NEVER** use `sendMessage("string")` - this does NOT work and will cause runtime errors
- Messages from useChat have a `parts` array structure, NOT a simple `content` field
- Tool calls are supported in the response format
- Requires environment variables in `.env.local`
- Reference: https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text#streamtext

### Agent Architecture

**Job Discovery Agent** - Autonomously finds jobs across multiple sources with progressive display
- Tools: Firecrawl MCP (scrape, search), Adzuna API, web search, display jobs, save jobs
- Responsibilities: Search strategy, source selection, result refinement, job discovery, progressive display
- Output: Jobs displayed incrementally in carousel as discovered (progressive UX)
- API: `/api/chat/route.ts`
- Prompt: `components/agent/prompts/job-discovery-prompt.ts`
- Progressive Display: Calls `displayJobs` after parsing each batch for real-time carousel updates

**Job Matching Agent** - Analyzes jobs against user profile with detailed scoring
- Tools: Firecrawl MCP (for company research), web search, score jobs
- Responsibilities: Job fit analysis, weighted scoring, gap identification, priority assignment
- Output: Scored jobs with reasoning, breakdown, and recommendations
- API: `/api/match/route.ts` (accepts jobs/profile from request body OR fetches from Supabase)
- Prompt: `components/agent/prompts/job-matching-prompt.ts`
- **Context-aware**: Full chat history passed to agent for improved scoring based on conversation context

**Resume Generator Agent** - Tailors master resumes for specific job opportunities
- Tools: Firecrawl MCP (for company research), web search, generate tailored resume
- Responsibilities: Resume analysis, content reordering, keyword integration, maintaining authenticity
- Output: Tailored resume with change documentation and alignment analysis
- API: `/api/resume/route.ts`
- Prompt: `components/agent/prompts/resume-generator-prompt.ts`
- Configuration: Uses GPT-5 with `reasoning_effort: 'medium'` for quality output
- Process: 5-step agent loop with `stopWhen: stepCountIs(5)`
- Critical Rules:
  - ❌ NEVER fabricate experience, skills, or accomplishments
  - ❌ NEVER add projects, companies, or roles not in master resume
  - ✅ ONLY reorder bullets, emphasize relevant experience, mirror keywords naturally

**Agent Coordination**
- Agents do NOT directly call each other
- Communication via Supabase database (shared state with Row Level Security)
- User controls workflow (explicit save/score requests)
- Each agent demonstrates autonomy within its domain
- **Graceful degradation**: Firecrawl MCP failures are caught and agents continue without MCP tools

### AI SDK Tools

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: You MUST read the AI SDK tools documentation before working with tools: https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-core/tools-and-tool-calling

**ALSO REQUIRED**: Read the manual agent loop cookbook for advanced patterns: https://ai-sdk.dev/cookbook/node/manual-agent-loop

This documentation is essential for understanding:
- How tools are called by language models
- Tool execution flow and lifecycle
- Tool choice strategies (`auto`, `required`, `none`, specific tool)
- Multi-step tool calling with `stopWhen` and `stepCountIs()`
- Tool call monitoring and error handling
- Manual agent loops for complex tool workflows

#### Current AI SDK API (v5.0.44+)

**IMPORTANT**: The AI SDK API has evolved. Always use current patterns:

##### Multi-Step Tool Execution with `stepCountIs()`

```typescript
const result = streamText({
  model: openai("gpt-5"),
  messages: modelMessages,
  tools: mcpTools,
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(10), // CURRENT API - replaces deprecated maxSteps
});
```

##### Tool Choice Strategies

Control how and when tools are called using the `toolChoice` parameter:

```typescript
const result = streamText({
  model: openai("gpt-5"),
  messages: modelMessages,
  tools: mcpTools,
  toolChoice: 'auto', // Options: 'auto', 'required', 'none', or specific tool name
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(5),
});
```

- **`auto` (default)**: Model decides whether to call tools based on context
- **`required`**: Model must call at least one tool before responding
- **`none`**: Disable all tool calls
- **Specific tool**: Force a particular tool to be called

#### MCP Tool Integration

This application uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) to integrate Firecrawl web scraping tools:

- **Location**: MCP client code is in `/lib/mcp/`
- **Dynamic Loading**: Tools are loaded at runtime from the Firecrawl MCP server
- **Current MCP Tools**: Firecrawl provides web scraping and content extraction capabilities
- **Tool Wrapping**: Tools are wrapped with logging to monitor execution
- **Error Handling**: Firecrawl connection failures are caught gracefully - agents continue without MCP tools if unavailable

Example from `/app/api/agent-with-mcp-tools/route.ts`:

```typescript
// Initialize Firecrawl MCP client
const firecrawlClient = getFirecrawlMCPClient();
await firecrawlClient.connect();

// Retrieve Firecrawl tools
const tools = await firecrawlClient.getTools();

// Wrap tools to log when they are called
const wrappedTools = Object.fromEntries(
  Object.entries(tools).map(([toolName, toolDef]) => [
    toolName,
    {
      ...toolDef,
      execute: async (args: any) => {
        console.log(`\n🔧 Tool called: ${toolName}`);
        console.log(`   Input:`, JSON.stringify(args, null, 2));
        const result = await toolDef.execute(args);
        console.log(`   Output:`, JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
        return result;
      },
    },
  ])
);
```

#### Custom Tools Implemented

**Adzuna API Tool** (`components/agent/tools/adzuna.ts`)
- Searches jobs across multiple companies via Adzuna API
- Input: query, location (optional), resultsCount (default 20, max 50)
- Output: Array of Job objects with action: "display"
- Used by Job Discovery Agent for broad job searches

**Save Jobs Tool** (`components/agent/tools/save-jobs.ts`)
- Saves selected jobs to user's profile (localStorage)
- Input: jobs array, criteria description (optional)
- Output: Saved jobs with action: "saved" and savedIds array
- Only called when user explicitly requests to save jobs
- Marks jobs with applicationStatus: "saved"

**Score Jobs Tool** (`components/agent/tools/score-jobs.ts`)
- Returns scored jobs with detailed fit analysis
- Input: scoredJobs array with score, breakdown, reasoning, gaps, priority
- Output: Scored jobs data with action: "scored" and statistics
- Used by Job Matching Agent to return analysis results
- Client-side handler updates localStorage

**Display Jobs Tool** (`components/agent/tools/display-jobs.ts`)
- Displays structured job data in the carousel (progressive display bridge)
- Input: jobs array (structured Job objects)
- Output: Jobs with action: "display" for carousel detection
- Performance: Executes in ~0.05ms with validation and logging
- Purpose: Bridges agent's internal job parsing (from Firecrawl scrapes) to UI carousel
- Architecture: Firecrawl returns raw HTML → Agent parses → displayJobs formats → Carousel displays
- Progressive Display: Called incrementally after each batch for real-time updates

**Generate Tailored Resume Tool** (`components/agent/tools/generate-resume.ts`)
- Generates tailored resumes for specific job opportunities
- Input: jobId, masterResumeId, jobTitle, jobCompany, masterResumeName, tailoredResumeContent, changes array, matchAnalysis
- Output: Tailored resume with action: "generated", change documentation, alignment score
- Helper function: `getResumeGenerationContext(job, masterResume)` accepts Job and Resume objects (not IDs)
- Context injection: Job details, requirements, master resume content, user profile formatted as string
- Architecture: Client passes job/resume objects to server; server passes to agent; agent returns complete data
- Used by Resume Generator Agent to return tailored resume results
- Client-side handler automatically saves resume to job via `saveJobResume()` in Supabase
- Changes tracked by type: reorder, keyword, emphasis, summary, trim, section_move

#### Creating New Tools and Agents

**IMPORTANT**: When building more agent and tools functionality, ALWAYS follow the existing patterns in `/components/agent/` and `/lib/mcp/` folders. Study the existing implementations before creating new ones.

When creating new AI SDK tools:
1. Create a new file in `/components/agent/tools/`
2. Use Zod schemas for input validation (not the `tool()` function)
3. Define clear Zod input schemas with descriptions
4. Implement error handling in the `execute` function
5. Export from `/components/agent/tools/index.ts`
6. Add the tool to the appropriate API route's tools configuration

When adding new MCP servers:
1. Follow the pattern established in `/lib/mcp/`
2. Create a new client class following `firecrawl-client.ts`
3. Implement connection and tool retrieval methods
4. Add tool wrapping for logging and monitoring

When creating new agents:
1. Follow the pattern established in `/app/api/chat/route.ts` or `/app/api/match/route.ts`
2. Create new prompts in `/components/agent/prompts/` following existing structures
3. Use the same streaming patterns and error handling as existing agents
4. Always include proper tool configurations
5. Wrap tools with logging for debugging

Example AI SDK tool:
```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

export const myTool = {
  description: 'Clear description of what the tool does',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    param: z.string().describe('What this parameter is for')
  }),
  execute: async ({ param }: { param: string }) => {
    // Tool implementation with logging
    console.log(`🔧 Tool called with param: ${param}`);
    return {
      action: 'display',
      result: 'data'
    };
  }
};
```

#### Tool Call Monitoring

Add logging in tools to monitor execution:

```typescript
// In tool execute function
execute: async ({ query }) => {
  console.log(`🔍 Tool executing with query: "${query}"`);
  try {
    const result = await performAction(query);
    console.log(`✅ Tool completed successfully`);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`💥 Tool error:`, error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

#### Tool Call UI Indicators

Display tool execution states using AI Elements:

```typescript
// In ChatAssistant component
{message.parts?.filter(part => part.type === "tool").map((part, i) => {
  const toolState = part.result
    ? "output-available"
    : part.input
      ? "input-available"
      : "input-streaming";

  return (
    <Tool defaultOpen={true}>
      <ToolHeader type={`tool-${part.toolName}`} state={toolState} />
      <ToolContent>
        {part.input && <ToolInput input={part.input} />}
        {part.result && <ToolOutput output={part.result} />}
        {toolState === "input-streaming" && (
          <div>🔍 Processing...</div>
        )}
      </ToolContent>
    </Tool>
  );
})}
```

#### Tool Call Best Practices

- **Clear Descriptions**: Write detailed descriptions to help the model choose the right tool
- **Specific Input Schemas**: Use descriptive Zod schemas with `.describe()` for parameters
- **Error Handling**: Always wrap tool execution in try-catch blocks
- **Logging**: Add console logging to track tool usage and debug issues
- **Return Structure**: Keep return types simple to avoid TypeScript complexity
- **UI Feedback**: Always show tool execution state using AI Elements components

### Chat Architecture

- **Global State**: `ChatContext` provider (`lib/context/ChatContext.tsx`) manages all chat state
  - Wraps entire app in `app/layout.tsx` for persistence across navigation
  - Hosts both `useChat` hooks at context level (prevents state loss on navigation)
  - Manages savedJobs, userProfile, activeAgent, sessionJobs, carouselVisible state
  - Fetches data from Supabase API instead of localStorage
  - Provides `clearChat()` method to reset conversation while preserving data
  - Provides `removeJobFromSession()` to remove jobs from carousel after saving
- **Frontend**: `ChatAssistant` component (`components/chat/chat-assistant.tsx`) with dual-agent support
  - Simplified by consuming state from ChatContext
  - No local state management - all state comes from context
  - 60/40 split layout: 60% chat area, 40% job carousel panel (desktop)
  - **Agent-specific tool indicators**: User-friendly icons and messages instead of technical tool names
    - Discovery Agent: 🔍 "Searching for jobs" or 💾 "Saving jobs"
    - Matching Agent: 📊 "Scoring jobs"
    - Clean, non-technical UI improves user experience
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Two `useChat` hooks (Discovery + Matching) merged into single conversation
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic agent selection based on user intent detection
  - Keywords: 'score', 'analyze', 'match', 'fit', 'rate', 'evaluate', 'assess', 'rank', 'priority', 'compare'
  - Checks for saved jobs and profile before routing to Matching Agent
- **API Routes**:
  - `/api/chat` - Job Discovery Agent
  - `/api/match` - Job Matching Agent (accepts jobs/profile from body OR fetches from Supabase)
  - `/api/resume` - Resume Generator Agent (tailors resumes for jobs)
- **Message Merging**: `React.useMemo` combines messages from both agents chronologically
- **Message Format**: Messages have `parts` array with typed parts (text, tool, etc.), NOT simple `content` field
- **Sending Messages**: MUST use `sendMessage({ text: "message" })` format - string format does NOT work
- **Streaming**: Official `useChat` hook handles streaming automatically for both agents
- **State Management**: Supabase integration via API routes, auto-refresh after agent actions
- **Chat Persistence**: Chat history persists across page navigation (in-memory via ChatContext)
  - **Full chat history passed to Matching Agent**: Improves scoring quality with conversation context
- **Clear Chat Feature**: AlertDialog confirms clearing history while preserving jobs and profile
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures via `status` monitoring
- **Job Carousel Integration**: Side panel displays discovered jobs with progressive updates
  - **Progressive Display**: Jobs appear incrementally as agent discovers them (real-time streaming)
  - **Auto-removal on save**: Jobs removed from carousel immediately after user saves them
  - Open by default with helpful empty state when no jobs discovered
  - Shows "Tinder-like" swipeable interface for reviewing discovered jobs
  - Users can save, skip, navigate through jobs with keyboard shortcuts
  - Closeable/reopenable for flexible workspace management
  - Mobile: Full-screen overlay with slide-in animation
  - Desktop: 40% width side panel with border separation
  - **Tool Detection**: ChatContext monitors `tool-*` and `dynamic-tool` types for carousel updates
  - **Performance**: Incremental updates create better perceived speed (~0.05ms per displayJobs call)

## Critical Rules for useChat Implementation

**NEVER EVER DO THIS:**
- ❌ `sendMessage("string")` - This DOES NOT work and causes runtime errors
- ❌ Accessing `message.content` directly - Messages use `parts` array structure
- ❌ Passing plain strings to sendMessage

**ALWAYS DO THIS:**
- ✅ `sendMessage({ text: "message content" })` - Only UIMessage-compatible objects work
- ✅ Access message content via `message.parts` array
- ✅ Read AI SDK docs before implementing any useChat functionality

Key Features:
- **Three specialized agents**: Discovery, Matching, Resume Generator
- **Unified interface**: Chat agents accessible in single conversation
- **React Context state**: Chat persists across navigation via ChatContext
- **Intelligent routing**: Keywords trigger appropriate agent
- **Message merging**: Chronologically combined streams
- **Context-aware**: Checks for required data before routing
- **Resume tailoring**: AI analyzes job requirements and reorders content (with optimized completion tracking)
- **Authenticity**: Never fabricates experience, only reorders and emphasizes
- **Communication via Supabase**: Shared state with Row Level Security
- **Graceful degradation**: Agents continue without MCP tools if Firecrawl fails
- **Protected routes**: Middleware enforces authentication
```

### Data Flow

1. **Authentication** → User signs in (email/password or Google OAuth)
2. **Job Discovery** → Jobs discovered and displayed temporarily in chat
3. **Explicit Save** → User selects which jobs to save to Supabase database
4. **Job Matching** → Agent fetches saved jobs from database, analyzes fit, returns scores
5. **Persistence** → Updated jobs with scores saved to Supabase database
6. **Resume Generation** → Tailored resumes saved to job records in database

# AI Job Application Agent - Project Summary

## Overview

The AI Job Application Agent is an intelligent job search and matching system designed to automate and optimize the job hunting process. Built with a multi-agent architecture, it combines autonomous job discovery with sophisticated fit analysis to help job seekers find and prioritize opportunities that match their qualifications and preferences.

This capstone project demonstrates advanced AI engineering concepts including multi-agent orchestration, tool-calling LLMs, web scraping via MCP, and intelligent scoring systems.

## Problem Statement

Job seekers spend 10-20+ hours per week manually searching for positions across multiple platforms. The process is fragmented and inefficient:
- Manually visiting company career pages and job boards
- Reading through dozens of job descriptions
- Comparing requirements against qualifications
- Losing track of applications and their status

**Solution:** An AI-powered system that autonomously discovers jobs from multiple sources, analyzes fit with detailed scoring and reasoning, and helps users focus on high-priority opportunities.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **AI/ML**: AI SDK 5 (Vercel), OpenAI GPT-5
- **Integrations**:
  - Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Firecrawl for web scraping
  - Adzuna API for job board searches
- **UI**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS v4), AI Elements
- **State Management**: localStorage (no database/authentication)
- **Build Tools**: Turbopack, pnpm

### Multi-Agent System

**Job Discovery Agent** (`/api/chat/route.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Autonomous job search across multiple sources
- **Tools**: Firecrawl MCP (scrape, search), Adzuna API, web search, save jobs
- **Capabilities**:
  - Decides which sources to search based on user query
  - Autonomously refines searches if initial results are insufficient
  - Determines when enough jobs have been found
  - Presents jobs temporarily (user must explicitly save)
- **Prompt**: 146-line system prompt defining autonomous behavior

**Job Matching Agent** (`/api/match/route.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Intelligent job fit analysis and scoring
- **Tools**: Firecrawl MCP (company research), web search, score jobs
- **Capabilities**:
  - Analyzes jobs against user profile using LLM reasoning
  - Generates weighted scores (0-100) across 5 categories
  - Identifies qualification gaps with actionable feedback
  - Assigns priority levels (high â‰¥85, medium 70-84, low <70)
- **Prompt**: 214-line system prompt defining scoring methodology

**Agent Coordination**
- Agents do NOT directly call each other
- Communication via localStorage (shared state pattern)
- User controls workflow with explicit commands
- Each agent demonstrates autonomy within its domain

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Source Job Discovery
- **Firecrawl MCP**: Scrapes company career pages in real-time
- **Adzuna API**: Searches job boards with 50+ sources
- **Autonomous decisions**: Agent chooses tools and search strategy
- **Result refinement**: Automatically adjusts if initial results are poor

### 2. Intelligent Job Scoring
- **Weighted scoring**: 5 configurable factors (salary, location, company, role, requirements)
- **Default weights**: Salary 30%, Company 25%, Location 20%, Role 15%, Requirements 10%
- **Detailed reasoning**: Natural language explanation for each score
- **Gap identification**: Lists missing qualifications with context
- **Priority assignment**: Auto-categorizes jobs by score threshold

### 3. Explicit Save Workflow
- Jobs discovered are **temporary** (displayed in chat)
- User must **explicitly save** jobs to profile
- Natural language save commands: "save top 5", "save all remote", "save jobs 2, 5, 12"
- Saved jobs persist in localStorage with status tracking

### 4. Chat-First Interface
- Built with AI Elements (Vercel's pre-built AI UI components)
- Streaming responses with visible tool execution
- Reasoning tokens displayed as collapsible blocks
- Natural language interaction for all operations

### 5. Data Persistence
- **localStorage-based**: No database or authentication required
- **User Profile**: Skills, salary range, preferences, scoring weights
- **Jobs**: Discovered jobs with optional scores and application status
- **SSR-safe**: All storage utilities check for browser environment

## Custom Tools Implementation

### Adzuna API Tool (`components/agent/tools/adzuna.ts`)
```typescript
- Input: query, location (optional), resultsCount (1-50)
- Output: Job[] with action: "display"
- Features: Auto-mapping to Job interface, salary formatting, requirement extraction
```

### Save Jobs Tool (`components/agent/tools/save-jobs.ts`)
```typescript
- Input: jobs[], criteria (optional description)
- Output: Saved jobs with action: "saved", savedIds[]
- Behavior: Marks jobs with applicationStatus: "saved", adds timestamp
```

### Score Jobs Tool (`components/agent/tools/score-jobs.ts`)
```typescript
- Input: scoredJobs[] (with score, breakdown, reasoning, gaps, priority)
- Output: Scored data with action: "scored", statistics
- Behavior: Returns analysis for client-side localStorage update
```

## Data Models

### Job Interface (`types/job.ts`)
```typescript
{
  id: string                    // UUID
  title: string
  company: string
  location: string
  salary?: string
  description: string
  requirements: string[]
  url: string
  source: "firecrawl" | "adzuna" | "manual"
  discoveredAt: string          // ISO timestamp

  // Scoring data (added by Matching Agent)

}
```

## Storage Utilities

### Profile Storage (`lib/storage/profile.ts`)
- `getProfile()`: Retrieve user profile or null
- `saveProfile(profile)`: Save with auto-timestamp
- `deleteProfile()`: Clear profile data
- `hasProfile()`: Check existence
- `updateProfile(updates)`: Merge partial updates

### Jobs Storage (`lib/storage/jobs.ts`)
- `getJobs()`: Retrieve all saved jobs
- `saveJobs(jobs)`: Replace jobs array
- `addJobs(newJobs)`: Append with deduplication
- `updateJobStatus(jobId, status)`: Change application status
- `updateJobsWithScores(scoredJobs)`: Merge score data by ID

# AI Job Application Agent - Project Summary

## Overview

The AI Job Application Agent is an intelligent job search and matching system designed to automate and optimize the job hunting process. Built with a multi-agent architecture, it combines autonomous job discovery with sophisticated fit analysis to help job seekers find and prioritize opportunities that match their qualifications and preferences.

This capstone project demonstrates advanced AI engineering concepts including multi-agent orchestration, tool-calling LLMs, web scraping via MCP, and intelligent scoring systems.

## Problem Statement

Job seekers spend 10-20+ hours per week manually searching for positions across multiple platforms. The process is fragmented and inefficient:
- Manually visiting company career pages and job boards
- Reading through dozens of job descriptions
- Comparing requirements against qualifications
- Losing track of applications and their status

**Solution:** An AI-powered system that autonomously discovers jobs from multiple sources, analyzes fit with detailed scoring and reasoning, and helps users focus on high-priority opportunities.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **AI/ML**: AI SDK 5 (Vercel), OpenAI GPT-5
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database, Authentication, Storage)
- **Integrations**:
  - Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Firecrawl for web scraping
  - Adzuna API for job board searches
- **UI**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS v4), AI Elements
- **Forms**: react-hook-form 7.65+ with @hookform/resolvers and Zod validation
- **State Management**: Supabase with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Build Tools**: Turbopack, pnpm
- **Icons**: Lucide React

### Multi-Agent System

**Job Discovery Agent** (`/api/chat/route.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Autonomous job search across multiple sources
- **Tools**: Firecrawl MCP (scrape, search), Adzuna API, web search, save jobs
- **Capabilities**:
  - Decides which sources to search based on user query
  - Autonomously refines searches if initial results are insufficient
  - Determines when enough jobs have been found
  - Presents jobs temporarily (user must explicitly save)
- **Prompt**: 146-line system prompt defining autonomous behavior

**Job Matching Agent** (`/api/match/route.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Intelligent job fit analysis and scoring
- **Tools**: Firecrawl MCP (company research), web search, score jobs
- **Capabilities**:
  - Analyzes jobs against user profile using LLM reasoning
  - Generates weighted scores (0-100) across 5 categories
  - Identifies qualification gaps with actionable feedback
  - Assigns priority levels (high ≥85, medium 70-84, low <70)
- **Prompt**: 214-line system prompt defining scoring methodology

**Resume Generator Agent** (`/api/resume/route.ts`)
- **Purpose**: AI-powered resume tailoring for specific job opportunities
- **Tools**: Firecrawl MCP (company research), web search, generate tailored resume
- **Capabilities**:
  - Analyzes job requirements and master resume content
  - Reorders experience bullets to emphasize relevant skills
  - Integrates keywords naturally from job descriptions
  - Maintains authenticity (never fabricates experience)
  - Documents all changes with detailed explanations
  - Provides alignment score and gap analysis
- **Prompt**: 293-line system prompt with explicit authenticity rules
- **Configuration**: Uses GPT-5 with `reasoning_effort: 'medium'` for quality
- **Process**: 5-step agent loop (Data Collection → Planning → Modification → Review → Documentation)
- **Critical Rules**:
  - ❌ NEVER fabricate experience, skills, or accomplishments
  - ❌ NEVER add projects, companies, or roles not in master resume
  - ✅ ONLY reorder bullets, emphasize relevant experience, mirror keywords naturally

**Agent Coordination**
- Agents do NOT directly call each other
- Communication via Supabase database (shared state with Row Level Security)
- User controls workflow with explicit commands
- Each agent demonstrates autonomy within its domain
- **Graceful degradation**: Firecrawl MCP failures are caught gracefully - agents continue without MCP tools if unavailable

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Source Job Discovery
- **Firecrawl MCP**: Scrapes company career pages in real-time (with graceful fallback if unavailable)
- **Adzuna API**: Searches job boards with 50+ sources
- **Autonomous decisions**: Agent chooses tools and search strategy
- **Result refinement**: Automatically adjusts if initial results are poor
- **Error resilience**: Continues operation even if Firecrawl connection fails

### 2. Intelligent Job Scoring
- **Weighted scoring**: 5 configurable factors (salary, location, company, role, requirements)
- **Default weights**: Salary 30%, Company 25%, Location 20%, Role 15%, Requirements 10%
- **Detailed reasoning**: Natural language explanation for each score
- **Gap identification**: Lists missing qualifications with context
- **Priority assignment**: Auto-categorizes jobs by score threshold

### 3. Explicit Save Workflow
- Jobs discovered are **temporary** (displayed in chat)
- User must **explicitly save** jobs to profile
- Natural language save commands: "save top 5", "save all remote", "save jobs 2, 5, 12"
- Saved jobs persist in Supabase database with status tracking and Row Level Security

### 4. Unified Multi-Agent Chat Interface
- **React Context state management** (`lib/context/ChatContext.tsx`):
  - Global ChatContext provider wraps entire app for persistence across navigation
  - Hosts both useChat hooks (Discovery + Matching) at context level
  - Chat history persists during browser session (cleared on refresh)
  - Manages savedJobs, userProfile, activeAgent state centrally
  - Provides `clearChat()` method and `handleSendMessage()` with intelligent routing
- **Dual-agent coordination**: Single conversation interface with both Discovery and Matching agents
- **Intelligent routing**: Automatic agent selection based on user intent detection
  - Keywords: 'score', 'analyze', 'match', 'fit', 'rate', 'evaluate', 'assess', 'rank', 'priority', 'compare'
  - Routes to Matching Agent when scoring keywords + saved jobs + profile exist
  - Checks for saved jobs and profile before routing
- **Message merging**: Chronologically combined messages from both agents
- **Context-aware**: Routes to Matching Agent when scoring keywords detected + saved jobs exist
- **Graceful fallbacks**: Handles missing profile or no saved jobs scenarios
- **Clear Chat feature**: AlertDialog with confirmation before clearing history
  - RotateCcw icon button at top of chat interface
  - Preserves saved jobs and profile data
  - Resets both agent conversations and message tracking
- Built with AI Elements (Vercel's pre-built AI UI components)
- Streaming responses with visible tool execution
- Reasoning tokens displayed as collapsible blocks
- Natural language interaction for all operations

## Implementation Highlights

### Multi-Agent Chat Interface (`components/chat/chat-assistant.tsx`)

**Dual useChat Hooks:**
```typescript
// Discovery Agent
const discoveryChat = useChat({
  transport: api ? new DefaultChatTransport({ api }) : undefined,
  onFinish: () => setSavedJobs(getJobs()),
});

// Matching Agent
const matchingChat = useChat({
  transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
    api: '/api/match',
    body: { jobs: savedJobs, profile: userProfile },
  }),
  onFinish: () => setSavedJobs(getJobs()),
});
```

**Intelligent Intent Detection:**
```typescript
const detectScoringIntent = (text: string): boolean => {
  const keywords = ['score', 'analyze', 'match', 'fit', 'rate',
                    'evaluate', 'assess', 'rank', 'priority', 'compare'];
  return keywords.some(keyword => text.toLowerCase().includes(keyword));
};
```

**Message Stream Merging:**
```typescript
const allRawMessages = React.useMemo(() => {
  const discovery = discoveryChat.messages.map(msg => ({
    ...msg, agentSource: 'discovery' as const
  }));
  const matching = matchingChat.messages.map(msg => ({
    ...msg, agentSource: 'matching' as const
  }));
  return [...discovery, ...matching].sort((a, b) =>
    a.id.localeCompare(b.id)
  );
}, [discoveryChat.messages, matchingChat.messages]);
```

**Smart Routing Logic:**
- Scoring intent + saved jobs + profile → Matching Agent
- Scoring intent + no saved jobs → Discovery Agent (helpful message)
- Scoring intent + no profile → Discovery Agent (profile creation prompt)
- All other queries → Discovery Agent (default)

**Lines of Code:** ~140 net lines added for full multi-agent coordination
